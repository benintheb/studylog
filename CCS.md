## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

IaaS is cloud-based services, pay-as-you-go for services such as storage, networking, and virtualization. Its examples are services such as AWS EC2, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Digital Ocean, and Magento 1 Enterprise Edition.

IaaS provides cloud computing services in alternative to on-premise infrastructures, so that businesses can reduce their budget on investing in on-site resources. On-site resources include expensive hardware investement, which require additional engagement with external IT contractors to maintain the hardware.

With IaaS, a business can buy what they need, and purchase in addition as the business grows. Replacing IaaS solutions without losing the initial investment is another advantage, for it is highly flexible and highly scalable.  
IaaS also puts control back in the business itself, because it no longer is in need of an external IT contractor. A business can access and oversee IaaS platforms itself.

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)

PaaS is hardware and software tools available over the internet. Its examples are AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Windows Azure (mostly used as PaaS), Force.com, OpenShift, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud.

PaaS is mainly used by developers looking to build applications or software. With PaaS, developers don't need to start from scratch when building, which saves a lot of time and energy writing extensive code. Developers can focus on creating, testing, and deploying the application, without having to invest time on managing software updates or security patches.

## SaaS (Software as a Service)

SaaS is software thatâ€™s available via a third-party over the internet. BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, MailChimp, ZenDesk, DocuSign, Slack, Hubspot are examples of SaaS.

SaaS enables a user to be free of installing or running a software on any computer. With an internet connection, everything is available online and can be accessed from any device, anywhere. Downloading the software onto multiple computers and keeping everything up-to-date is no longer an issue with SaaS. Everything is taken care of on the cloud, and maintenance, compliance, and security services are all taken care of. There is a variety of solutions for businesses, for SaaS is scalable, with different tiers for small, medium, and enterprise-level businesses.

- IaaS is there to provide you with maximum flexibility when it comes to hosting custom-built apps, as well as a providing a general data center for data storage.
- PaaS is most often built on top of an IaaS platform to reduce the need for system administration. It allows you to focus on app development instead of infrastructure management.
- SaaS offers ready-to-use, out-of-the-box solutions that meet a particular business need (such as website or email). Most modern SaaS platforms are built on IaaS or PaaS platforms.
