## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

IaaS is cloud-based services, pay-as-you-go for services such as storage, networking, and virtualization. Its examples are services such as AWS EC2, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Digital Ocean, and Magento 1 Enterprise Edition.

IaaS provides cloud computing services in alternative to on-premise infrastructures, so that businesses can reduce their budget on investing in on-site resources.  
On-site resources include expensive hardware investement, which require additional engagement with external IT contractors to maintain the hardware.

With IaaS, a business can buy what they need, and purchase in addition as the business grows. Replacing IaaS solutions without losing the initial investment is another advantage, for it is highly flexible and highly scalable.  
IaaS also puts control back in the business itself, because it no longer is in need of an external IT contractor. A business can access and oversee IaaS platforms itself.

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)

PaaS is hardware and software tools available over the internet. Its examples are AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Windows Azure (mostly used as PaaS), Force.com, OpenShift, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud.

## SaaS (Software as a Service)

SaaS is software thatâ€™s available via a third-party over the internet. BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, MailChimp, ZenDesk, DocuSign, Slack, Hubspot.
