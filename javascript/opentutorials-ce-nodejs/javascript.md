## Boolean

Boolean is a datatype that only consists of two kinds of data. `true` and `false`.

- `true` and `false` cannot be used as names of variables, for those names are promised to be used by `boolean` alone.

## Comparison & Logical Operators

### Comparison Operators

These are operators that compare values and return them in a boolean type(`true` or `false`).

The operators include `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, and `!==`.

There is a strict equality operator(`===`) in JavaScript. Unlike the equality operator(`==`), the strict equality operator considers the same values of different types false. To be equal, the value **and** the type has to be the same.

    console.log(1 === 1);   // true

    console.log('hello' === 'hello');   // true

    console.log('1' == 1);      // true
    console.log('1' ===  1);    // false

    console.log(0 == false);    // true
    console.log(0 === false);   // false

### Logical Operators

These are operators that combine multiple boolean values and return a single boolean output. 

The operators include `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
