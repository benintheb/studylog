- The red part is the protocol. It defines how a client is going to communicate with the server.  
HTTP is short for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It's a protocol to transfer data in the web.

- The green part is the domain name. Also called as a host. It is to recognize a computer on the network on a wider scale. On a narrower(more widely used) scale, it is a name that is registered from a domain registry.

- The pink part is the port. A port is like a docking station for a computer to connect to services and programs on the Internet. It is a way that a client connects to a server.  
Well known ports such as the Web protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol are given preassigned numbers for their ports. Other programs are given ports dynamically for connections.

- The blue part is the path, it leads the client to the directory of the file inquired.

- The turquoise part is the query string. The query string assigns values to specified parameters. Through the query string a client can send data over to the web server.  
Query strings start with `?`, and uses `&` between values. A value and its name are linked with `=`.
